# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description

I created a Note Taker Application using Express.js that allows the user to write a note with a Title and Text, Save the Note, and Delete the note. I used get, post, delete methods to make it work from the server side. My application is deployed with Heroku 


## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
